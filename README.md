    BMCC Hackathon 2019
</p>

<p> 
    <b><u>Description</u></b> <br>
    This will help students to know the location to the BMCC offices by simply asking Alexa. This can reduce the waiting time for the students in front of the information desk to ask the direction to the offices. This can be really helpful for students who need special accommodations, students who do not have time to come to the Main Building where the information desk located, and students who are shy and do not like to talk to people. 
</p>

<p> 
    How to start? Start Alexa by saying "Open BMCC Hub".
    Alexa will give a user two options 
<ul>
    <li> 
        Directory <br>
        How to ask Alexa direction? Just say "Where is <b> Office Name </b>" or "Give me the direction to <b> Office Name </b>"
    </li>
    <li> 
        Events <br>
        How to ask Alexa events? Just say "What is the next event" or "Events"
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
    <b><u>How we built it</u></b> <br>
    For events, we scrap data from the BMCC website. For departments, we created a two-dimensional array to store the departments' names and the location of each department.
    <br>
    <b><u>Built With</u></b>
    <ul>
        <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
        <li>Amazon Alexa</li>
        <li>node.js</li>
        <li>lambda</li>
        <li>ASK(Alexa skill kits)</li>
        <li>SDK</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
    <b><u>Challenges we ran into</u></b>
    <ul>
        <li>Not able to ask for a specific event</li>
        <li>Need to go through a list of events for one day only</li>
</ul>
</p>
    
<p>
    <b><u>What's next for BMCC Hub</u></b> <br>
    To make it better and more user-friendly. For events, we plan to add these following items. 
    <ul> 
        <li>Allowing students to search for a specific event</li>
        <li>Lessening the waiting time to get the answer back from Alexa</li>
</ul>
    For departments, we plan to add more information, for example, the office hours, and the events if there is one.
